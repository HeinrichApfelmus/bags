{-|
A unordered, finite collection of items.
Items may appear more than once.

Bag is the free commutative monoid.
-}
data Bag a = MkBag{elements :: [a]}

{-|
The empty 'Bag'.
-}
empty :: Bag a
empty = MkBag []

{-|
'Bag' with a single element.
-}
singleton :: a -> Bag a
singleton x = MkBag [x]

{-|
Create a 'Bag' from a list of items.
-}
fromList :: [a] -> Bag a
fromList = MkBag

{-|
Return a 'Bag' with one element if the condition is 'True',
and 'empty' if the condition is 'False'.
Very useful for @do@ notation.

From "Control.Monad".
-}
guard :: Bool -> Bag ()
guard True = singleton ()
guard False = empty

{-|
Is the item in the 'Bag'?
-}
member :: Eq a => a -> Bag a -> Bool
member x (MkBag xs) = elem x xs

{-|
Delete the first occurrence of an item from the list.
Return 'Nothing' if the element does not occur.
-}

delete1 x (y : ys)

Two lists are equal as bags.

The union of two 'Bag's contains all items from each of the 'Bag's.

'union' is commutative.

Filter all elements that satisfy the predicate.
